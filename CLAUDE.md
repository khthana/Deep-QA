# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in the DEEP-QA repository.

DEEP-QA is a curriculum & learning-outcomes management system, split into
`DEEP-QA-BACKEND/` (Express + Swagger) and `DEEP-QA-FRONTEND/` (CRA + Tailwind).
Each app has its own README; the frontend has its own `CLAUDE.md` with
app-specific architecture notes.

## Current state — read this first

The two `DEEP-QA-*` directories are the **student implementation as delivered** and are
now **read-only reference**. There is no database for them and they are not being
edited. The rebuild lands in fresh `backend/`, `frontend/` and `db/` trees, one screen
at a time, and the reference directories are deleted when it completes.

Work is tracked as GitHub issues: [#1](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/1) is
the spec, [#2](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/2)–[#46](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/46)
are the tickets, wired with native blocking dependencies. Take work from the
frontier — tickets whose blockers are all closed. #2–#45 are the original 44 from
`docs/07`; numbers above that are gaps found during the rebuild and opened since.

The newest file in `docs/handoff/` says where the rebuild stands, what is half-done and what
will cost time. Read it before taking work.

## Documentation map

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Domain glossary. Use its vocabulary in issues, tests and commits. |
| `docs/adr/` | Decisions that are hard to reverse. Read before touching keys, authorisation or the CLO grain. |
| `docs/01`–`05` | Extracted from the thesis and from scanning the student code. **Descriptive of what was delivered, not prescriptive of what to build** — each carries a note where the rebuild diverges. |
| `docs/06-implementation-plan.md` | The spec the rebuild implements. |
| `docs/handoff/` | Session handoffs, newest last. The most recent one is the current state of the rebuild. |
| `docs/07-ticket-breakdown.md` | The original 44 tickets, their dependency graph and the critical path. Tickets opened after it was published are on GitHub only. |

Three decisions govern most of the work and are easy to violate by accident:
keys follow the three tiers of ADR-0001; authorisation is derived server-side from the
database and never from a request body (ADR-0002); and CLOs and the weighting scheme
belong to a (Program, Subject, academic year), not to a Section (ADR-0003).

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in this repo's GitHub Issues at `khthana/Deep-QA`, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, using their default label strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — one `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
