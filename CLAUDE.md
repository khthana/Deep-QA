# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in the DEEP-QA repository.

DEEP-QA is a curriculum & learning-outcomes management system, split into
`DEEP-QA-BACKEND/` (Express + Swagger) and `DEEP-QA-FRONTEND/` (CRA + Tailwind).
Each app has its own README; the frontend has its own `CLAUDE.md` with
app-specific architecture notes.

## Current state — read this first

The two `DEEP-QA-*` directories are the **student implementation as delivered** and are
now **read-only reference**. There is no database for them and they are not being
edited. The rebuild lands in fresh `backend/`, `frontend/`, `db/` and `e2e/` trees, one screen
at a time, and the reference directories are deleted when it completes.

Work is tracked as GitHub issues: [#1](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/1) is
the spec, [#2](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/2)–[#46](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/46)
are the tickets, wired with native blocking dependencies. Take work from the
frontier — tickets whose blockers are all closed. #2–#45 are the original 44 from
`docs/07`; numbers above that are gaps found during the rebuild and opened since.

The newest file in `docs/handoff/` says where the rebuild stands, what is half-done and what
will cost time. Read it before taking work. Each handoff names the one it supersedes for state,
so follow that chain rather than the filenames.

## Two test seams

Work is tested at the backend HTTP surface (`backend/test/*.test.js`) and, since #65, in the
browser (`e2e/`, Playwright — its own stack on ports 3100/5100 and schema `deep_core_e2e`,
reseeded on every run). The browser seam asserts **behaviour**; anything an acceptance row states
in terms of **appearance** — colours, wording, menu contents, "this is text and not a control" —
stays a hand-walked row.

Acceptance rows are therefore marked ☑ walked · ◐ half-walked · ☐ not walked · **⚙ covered by the
browser seam** (the row names the spec file). A row is only marked ⚙ after a mutation test shows
the new assertion — that one, not an earlier one — failing when the code it is about is broken.

## Documentation map

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Domain glossary. Use its vocabulary in issues, tests and commits. |
| `docs/adr/` | Decisions that are hard to reverse. Read before touching keys, authorisation or the CLO grain. |
| `docs/01`–`05` | Extracted from the thesis and from scanning the student code. **Descriptive of what was delivered, not prescriptive of what to build** — each carries a note where the rebuild diverges. |
| `docs/thesis/` | The thesis `docs/01`–`04` were extracted from. Only for checking an extraction against the original. |
| `docs/06-implementation-plan.md` | The spec the rebuild implements. |
| `docs/acceptance/` | One checklist per screen ticket, and the record of how each row was proved. A ticket closes on it. |
| `docs/handoff/` | Session handoffs, newest last. The most recent one is the current state of the rebuild. |
| `docs/07-ticket-breakdown.md` | The original 44 tickets, their dependency graph and the critical path. Tickets opened after it was published are on GitHub only. |
| `mutation/` | The mutations that proved each ⚙ row's assertions. Read its README before trusting or rewriting one. |

Three decisions govern most of the work and are easy to violate by accident:
keys follow the three tiers of ADR-0001; authorisation is derived server-side from the
database and never from a request body (ADR-0002); and CLOs and the weighting scheme
belong to a (Program, Subject, academic year), not to a Section (ADR-0003).

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in this repo's GitHub Issues at `khthana/Deep-QA`, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, using their default label strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — one `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
