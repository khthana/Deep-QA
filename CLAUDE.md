# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in the DEEP-QA repository.

DEEP-QA is a curriculum & learning-outcomes management system, split into
`DEEP-QA-BACKEND/` (Express + Swagger) and `DEEP-QA-FRONTEND/` (CRA + Tailwind).
Each app has its own README; the frontend has its own `CLAUDE.md` with
app-specific architecture notes.

## Current state — read this first

The two `DEEP-QA-*` directories are the **student implementation as delivered** and are
now **read-only reference**. There is no database for them and they are not being
edited. The rebuild lands in fresh `backend/`, `frontend/`, `db/` and `e2e/` trees, one screen
at a time, and the reference directories are deleted when it completes.

Work is tracked as GitHub issues: [#1](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/1) is
the spec and everything from [#2](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/2) up is a ticket,
wired with native blocking dependencies. Take work from the frontier — tickets whose blockers are
all closed. #2–#45 are the original 44 from `docs/07`; numbers above that are gaps and defects
found during the rebuild and opened since.

Closed through #38, [#26](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/26) (Work Groups),
[#34](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/34) (Activity marks) and
[#38](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/38) (Learning detail heatmap) included.
Every acceptance checklist has been walked. Five rows in the whole store are not ticked, and each
is blocked on something other than a person at a screen: four name a request no control on any
screen can produce, and one is a wording the person who wrote it should not tick. The newest
handoff names all five.

An earlier version of this paragraph said the same of fifteen rows. Eleven of those turned out to
be walkable after all — they were waiting not on a person but on a **situation the seed does not
contain**, and building the situation and restoring it afterwards is a normal part of a walk. Read
a row that claims a seam proves it better than an eye as a claim to check, not a conclusion.

The newest file in `docs/handoff/` says where the rebuild stands, what is half-done and what
will cost time. Read it before taking work. Each handoff names the one it supersedes for state,
so follow that chain rather than the filenames.

## Two test seams

Work is tested at the backend HTTP surface (`backend/test/*.test.js`) and, since #65, in the
browser (`e2e/`, Playwright — its own stack on ports 3100/5100 and schema `deep_core_e2e`,
reseeded on every run). The browser seam asserts **behaviour**; anything an acceptance row states
in terms of **appearance** — colours, wording, menu contents, "this is text and not a control" —
stays a hand-walked row.

Acceptance rows are therefore marked ☑ walked · ◐ half-walked · ☐ not walked · **⚙ covered by the
browser seam** (the row names the spec file). A row is only marked ⚙ after a mutation test shows
the new assertion — that one, not an earlier one — failing when the code it is about is broken.

## Documentation map

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Domain glossary. Use its vocabulary in issues, tests and commits. |
| `docs/adr/` | Decisions that are hard to reverse. Read before touching keys, authorisation or the CLO grain. |
| `docs/01`–`05` | Extracted from the thesis and from scanning the student code. **Descriptive of what was delivered, not prescriptive of what to build** — each carries a note where the rebuild diverges. |
| `docs/thesis/` | The thesis `docs/01`–`04` were extracted from. Only for checking an extraction against the original. |
| `docs/06-implementation-plan.md` | The spec the rebuild implements. |
| `docs/acceptance/` | One checklist per screen ticket, and the record of how each row was proved. A ticket closes on it. |
| `docs/handoff/` | Session handoffs, newest last. The most recent one is the current state of the rebuild. |
| `docs/07-ticket-breakdown.md` | The original 44 tickets, their dependency graph and the critical path. Tickets opened after it was published are on GitHub only. |
| `mutation/` | The mutations that proved each ⚙ row's assertions. Read its README before trusting or rewriting one. |

Four decisions govern most of the work and are easy to violate by accident:
keys follow the three tiers of ADR-0001; authorisation is derived server-side from the
database and never from a request body (ADR-0002); CLOs and the weighting scheme
belong to a (Program, Subject, academic year), not to a Section (ADR-0003); and which
Section a teacher screen is looking at lives in the URL and nowhere else (ADR-0004).

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in this repo's GitHub Issues at `khthana/Deep-QA`, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, using their default label strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — one `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
