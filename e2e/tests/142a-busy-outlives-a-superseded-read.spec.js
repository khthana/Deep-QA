/**
 * #142 — a read that lands late does not give a write its button back.
 *
 * Eight screens read a row afresh before opening its form or its panel, and
 * each read held the screen's one `busy` flag — the flag that disables บันทึก,
 * the confirmation, and the panel's section controls while a write is out. The
 * read's `finally` put that flag down whether or not the read was still the one
 * the screen wanted, and whether or not a write had picked the flag up since.
 *
 * ## What was measured before the fix
 *
 * Three orders on ข้อมูลภาควิชา, on 19 September 2569 at `8bb9a92`:
 *
 * - **a read, a second read, a save** — the ticket's. The second read's
 *   `finally` puts the flag down while the first is still out, so the second
 *   form opens with บันทึก pressable; pressed, the save picks the flag up, and
 *   the first read's `finally` then puts it down under the save. บันทึก was
 *   pressable again with the save still out. **Red, as the ticket said.**
 * - **a read, then ลบ** — not a way in. The first read's flag is still up when
 *   the confirmation opens, so its button is disabled until the read lands, and
 *   the delete can only start after it has.
 * - **a save, then ลบ** — not a way in either. ยกเลิก is pressable during a
 *   save, so the table comes back, but the save's flag is up and the
 *   confirmation opens disabled. Two writes cannot overlap: every control that
 *   starts one is disabled by the flag, and nothing but a read puts it down
 *   early.
 *
 * So the one thing that can end another's hold is a read, because a read is
 * the one thing the table lets start while the flag is up. It can do that in
 * two orders:
 *
 * - **superseded** — a read another read has overtaken lands after a write
 *   started. The ticket's order, the first row on every screen.
 * - **current** — a write is out, what sent it is closed with ยกเลิก (which
 *   the flag does not disable), and a read started from the table lands while
 *   the write is still out. The read was the one asked for; the flag it put
 *   down was the write's. There are two ยกเลิก to close with. The
 *   confirmation's is on every list screen: the second row. The form's was
 *   pressable during a save on ข้อมูลภาควิชา, ข้อมูลหลักสูตร and ข้อมูลรายวิชา
 *   alone when this file was written, the other four forms disabling it with
 *   the flag; **since #242, on 28 ตุลาคม 2569, all seven leave it pressable**,
 *   the flag that closes a form's fields being the form's own there too. On each
 *   of them แก้ไข on the same row then sends the same save a second time: the
 *   fourth row, measured red before #142's fix on the three screens that had
 *   the way in, and green on the four that gained it — those four are a reach
 *   claim about code #142 already proved, not a second proof of it (#191).
 *
 * ## The third row on each screen
 *
 * The ticket said why #139's guard could not be copied here: a read that
 * released only when it was still `asked` would never release when เพิ่ม or ลบ
 * took its place — they write `asked` and pick up no flag of their own — and a
 * confirmation opened meanwhile would stay disabled for good. The fix does not
 * ask `asked`; the third row holds that it does not, by opening ลบ while a read
 * is out and waiting for the confirmation to come back.
 *
 * ## How a row is built
 *
 * With `gate`, not with a timer: the row says when the held read lands, after
 * the write has left. Every held write is answered with a made-up 409, so no
 * row changes the database. The second and fourth rows read the button once the
 * form the read opened is on the screen: the read's `finally` runs in the same tick as
 * the `setEditing` that draws it, and React commits the two together. The
 * first row has no such point — the overtaken read draws nothing, and nothing
 * on the screen marks a flag that was rightly left alone (#50) — so it reads
 * the button once, `SETTLE_MS` after the held answer has been handed to the
 * page.
 *
 * ## What this file writes
 *
 * One subject, placed into the seeded หลักสูตร, as `139a` does and for the same
 * reason: ข้อมูลรายวิชา and รายวิชาในหลักสูตร need a second row, and a row that
 * holds a defect builds its situation itself (#129). `hold()` takes it out.
