/**
 * #210 - the administration pagers take `busy`, so a write that is out closes
 * the pager rather than leaving it live.
 *
 * `Pager` has carried a `busy` since [#199](https://github.com/khthana/Deep-QA/issues/199),
 * written first into `disabled={busy || page <= 1}` and `disabled={busy || page >= pages}`,
 * and one of its eleven call sites passed it: the enrolment screen's, where
 * #199 measured what a live pager under a pending write costs. The other ten
 * were unchanged **by construction and not by measurement**, which is the
 * sentence #210 exists to settle.
 *
 * Measured on 19 ตุลาคม 2569 before anything was changed: of the six
 * administration screens the ticket names, only `Rubrics` can reach the window
 * in today's seed - #57's end rule disables both buttons on a one-page list, and
 * the other five read *หน้า 1 จาก 1*. The two windows #199 found (the write out,
 * and the reload out) no longer fork what the person is told, #205 having keyed
 * the sentence to the read that draws what it is about; what was left was one
 * behaviour - the sentence drawn over the page the person had moved to - and the
 * owner's answer on 19 ตุลาคม 2569 was option 1: send `busy` to all six.
 *
 * ## What each row claims
 *
 * The rule is one line at six sites, and `Pager` is one component, so no mutant
 * at the component can tell the sites apart. Each row is therefore a
 * **reachability** claim of its own (#191): that this screen's pager really is
 * handed the flag, and that a removal held at the route really does close it.
 * The control read above each claim is the same button with nothing out, which
 * is what keeps a red a measurement (#171) - a button disabled by #57's end rule
 * would read `disabled` on the broken screen too.
 *
 * ## The two sites with no row here
 *
 * `ProgramSubjects` and `Offerings` carry the same line and are not rowed, which
 * is a measurement rather than an omission. A row needs a second page, and
 * measured on 19 ตุลาคม 2569 the seed gives the committee **one** pair and **two**
 * offerings in the term the screen opens on; the pairs can be imported but an
 * offering needs a (programme, subject) pair for every row, so a second page of
 * offerings is a seed change rather than a fixture (growing the seed is the
 * owner's call). The sheet carries this as ☐ with the date.
 *
 * Each row writes - an import, and a removal that really lands - so the file
 * holds the schema and puts it back when it ends (#134).
