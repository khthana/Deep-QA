#38 รายละเอียดผลการเรียนรู้ - a heatmap, and the rules that colour it.

Twelve mutants. This is the first screen in the rebuild that computes rather
than records, so most of what could go wrong here is a *plausible wrong
number* rather than a crash - which is what docs/06 warns about and why the
arithmetic is pinned at the HTTP surface instead.

These twelve are therefore the other half: what only exists once the numbers
are drawn. A heatmap is a claim about colour, and a colour can be wrong in
ways a JSON body cannot - every band the same shade, the ramp shifted by one
so the edges land in the wrong colour, the flag that is only a hue, a grid
that takes the page sideways with it.

Two rules of this ticket have no mutant here on purpose. That sixty per cent
is *strictly* more than sixty (BR-17, and `docs/04` TC-EVAL-004), and that a
blank is left out of both halves of the fraction rather than read as a nought,
are both invisible in the browser: the screen is handed a band and a pass rate
and draws them either way. They are proved in `learning-details.test.js`,
which asks this file's own route directly, and the acceptance sheet marks
those rows from that seam rather than claiming a browser row it does not have.

One of them no longer lives in this ticket's files. `bandoffbyone` broke the
band ramp where #38 wrote it, in `routes/learningDetails.js`; `bandOf` moved to
`lib/attainment.js` when #42 needed BR-20 one level up, and the mutant went on
naming the old address until #123 found it MISSing. Applying it now breaks the
banding of every screen that bands - measured 7 September 2569, that is `38a`
row 2 in the browser and nothing else there, plus four subtests at the HTTP
seam. `42a` `43a` `44a` `45a` all pass with it applied, because no seeded
cohort mean lands exactly on a band edge.
