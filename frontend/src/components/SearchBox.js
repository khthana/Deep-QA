 * How long typing has to stop before the list is asked again - #272.
 *
 * The delivered box filtered the rows in hand on every keystroke
 * (`DEEP-QA-FRONTEND/src/components/SeachSection.js`, `onChange`); the
 * rebuild's list is the server's, so the same box would send a read per
 * character. The owner's answer of 12 November 2569 was *on typing, with a
 * short delay*. The delay decides nothing about what is drawn - which answer is
 * drawn is each screen's `isCurrent` guard (#68) - it only spares the reads
 * nobody would have looked at (#52).

/**
 * The search box on the left of `PageHeader` - #272, the slot #270 left for it.
 *
 * Drawn as the delivered one was: a magnifier inside a grey box, the
 * placeholder naming what is searched (`ค้นหาภาควิชา`). The placeholder is also
 * its accessible name, because a placeholder alone is not one a screen reader
 * can rely on.
 *
 * It holds what is being typed and hands the parent the term once typing
 * pauses, so the list is keyed on the term the parent holds and never on a
 * keystroke. `value` is where the box starts: the box is drawn in the branch a
 * form replaces, so it is mounted again when the form closes, and it starts
 * from the term the list is filtered on rather than from empty. A term still
 * waiting when the box goes - a form opened within the delay - is dropped
 * rather than sent: sending it would move the list's key while a form is open,
 * which `held-sentences.js` relies on nothing doing (#246), and the box comes
 * back showing the term the list is actually on.
 *
 * A term the list is already on, once trimmed - typed and taken back, or a
 * space added - is not handed on: the server trims it to the same search, so
 * handing it on would only put the person back on page one with nothing else
 * changed (the review of 12 November 2569).
