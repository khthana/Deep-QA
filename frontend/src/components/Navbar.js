   * #228's shape, on the one screen in #243's population where its premise
   * does not hold — 29 ตุลาคม 2569.
   *
   * #228 called its defect *what the person sees and what is being saved part
   * company*, and argued it was no worse than that because *the บันทึก button
   * of all five screens is `disabled={busy}` already, so moving a field in
   * between does not cause a second send*. That is a claim about each screen
   * (#133), and measured over #243's own population it is true of
   * twenty-five submit buttons and false of two: this one, which held nothing
   * at all, and `LoginForm.js`, whose reason is written in that file.
   *
   * So the window here was not only a divergence. Nothing stopped a second
   * press of *บันทึกรหัสใหม่* while the first change was out, and the second
   * request carries the old password that the first one has by then replaced:
   * the person presses save twice and is told their current password is
   * wrong, over a change that succeeded. `10a` row 7 holds that a refusal
   * leaves this dialog open, so the divergence lasts until they look again.
   *
   * The flag is the form's own and not the page's `busy` — there is no page
   * flag here to borrow, and the form's own is what the owner answered on
   * 26 ตุลาคม 2569. It closes the three fields and the button that sends them.
   * *ยกเลิก* holds nothing, by that same answer: a person who has given up on
   * a save must be able to leave. The eyes are not fields and keep their
   * press — revealing what was typed changes nothing about what is being
   * sent, which is the whole of what this flag is about.

                second. That fifth of a second is the accepted price, and
                what is paid at the far end is one fade at most: the tween
                resumed on the first frame after the return either jumps
                straight to its end (gone in 4-8ms, 1 sampled frame) or runs

                308ms) - both were read on this same code on 25 October 2569,
