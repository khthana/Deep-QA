 * what the screens share is worth writing once, because the second and third

 *
 * They are here rather than in `lib/importer` because they are not about
 * importing. A typed form uses them as much as a spreadsheet row does - that is
 * the point of `readUser`, `readDepartment` and `readProgram` each being one
 * function for both.
